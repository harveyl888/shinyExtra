# shinyExtra
In a similar manner to the [shinyBS](https://github.com/ebailey78/shinyBS) package by [@ebailey78](https://github.com/ebailey78), here are some additional functions that I often use in shiny apps.

## Install

```r
library(devtools)
devtools::install_github("harveyl888/shinyExtra")
```

## Usage
#### SXPanel
``` r
SXPanel(inputId, ..., heading = '', text_size = NULL, styleclass = 'default', checkbox = FALSE, collapsible = FALSE, icon = NULL)
```
Add a bootstrap panel to a shiny app.  The panel can be collapsible and display an glyphicon icon to the right of the panel header.  It may also have a checkbox, displayed to the left of the panel header, which is exposed as inputId_check.
#### SXlabel
``` r
SXLabel(inputId, label=NULL, styleclass = 'default', link = NULL)
```
Add a label with an optional hyperlink.
#### SXTextArea
``` r
SXTextArea(inputId, label = NULL, text = NULL, placeholder = NULL, resizable = TRUE, rows = 5, cols = 40)
```
Add a multiline input, default size = 5 rows, 40px wide.  If cols = '100%' then the input will expand to its parent's width.
#### SXSortable
``` r
SXSortable(inputId, labels = NULL, styleclass = NULL, headers = NULL, colorByGroup = TRUE, width = NULL, height = '120px')
```
Add multiple sortable lists of labels based using jquery-ui sortable.  Labels can be moved between lists and the contents of each list can be returned as shiny variables (`inputId_val_n`) where *n* is the list number.
Data are input as a list of lists, along with lists of styleclasses and headers for example:
```r
SXSortable('sort1', labels = list(list("label 1", "label 2", "label 3"), list("label 4", "label 5")), styleclass = list("success", "primary"), headers=list("title 1", "title 2"), height = 100)
```
would generate the following output:  
![](./images/SXSortable_image_01.png)  
and the shiny variables `input$sort1_val_1` and `input$sort1_val_2` would contain the values of the two boxes.  
This function is still being worked on and is still somewhat *experimental*.
